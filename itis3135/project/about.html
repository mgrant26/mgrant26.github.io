    <p>My name is Emma, and I am a local Photographer based out of Charlotte, NC (but willing to travel!)  I also am a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with the expected graduation in 2024!</p>
    <p>Growing up, I always had a passion for photography, but I never took it seriously and eventually lost my love. It wasn't until recently that I rediscovered my passion for it! I realized that it wasn't just the act of taking photos that brought me joy but also giving people unforgettable experiences that they can keep with them forever.</p>
    <p>Helping people love themselves has always been a big passion of mine. Photography has been the key to spreading self-appreciation and happiness to more people! Not only does it help people love themselves in the moment, but it also gives them everlasting love in a photo; plus, who doesn't enjoy a glam moment?</p>
    <p>When I'm not spreading love through pictures, I like to spread love to my 3-year-old puppy, Abbey, by taking her on walks and giving her shopping sprees. Between spoiling my puppy and being a student, I love playing my Wii and Switch and watching cringy movies with my boyfriend, Michael.
</p>
<p>My goal and favorite thing to do is spread laughter/love and capture it, giving everyone an opportunity to be themselves!</p>
